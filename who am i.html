            <p>
              One of my strongest skills would be my skill for creativity. I
              love being creative and expressing myself in many ways. From
              creating art and designs to making videos and taking photos. I
              love to be out with my close friends and I love spending time
              creating things using my computer.

              I made this website to show my self expression and my creations
              but also just for fun to show to other people and use as a
